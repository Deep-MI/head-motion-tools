# Quantifying MR head motion using markerless tracking

This is repository for rigid & robust point cloud registeration and analysis of head motion as desribed in our paper "Quantifying MR head motion in the Rhineland Study - A robust method for population cohorts" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120176.

You can find the code for robust point-cloud estimation in the folder: robust_registration

Tools for processing the resulting transformation matrices will follow shortly.
