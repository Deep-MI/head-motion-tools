# Quantifying MR head motion using markerless tracking

This is repository for rigid & robust point cloud registeration and analysis of head motion as desribed in our paper "Quantifying MR head motion in the Rhineland Study - A robust method for population cohorts" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120176.


We will upload the code soon.
